# Aliases

Here are some aliases that I've found useful

## How to Use:

1. Clone the repo
2. Copy the aliases file to home directory (preferably)
3. For **zsh**, add the following line in `.zshrc`:

   ```sh
   [ -f ~/aliases.zsh ] && source ~/aliases.zsh
   ```
4. For **bash**, according to convention, rename as `.bash_aliases`, then add the following line in `.bashrc`:

   ```sh
   [ -f ~/.bash_aliases ] && source ~/.bash_aliases
   ```
5. Run:

   ```sh
   source ~/.zshrc  # or
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```
